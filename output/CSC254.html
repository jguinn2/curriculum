</div><h3>Texbook</h3><h2>Objectives</h2><ul><li>Implement simple search algorithms and explain the differences in their time complexities.
      
    </li><li>Construct a simple user interface using a standard API.
      
    </li><li>Demonstrate the identification and graceful handling of error conditions.
      
    </li><li>Describe the main concepts of the OO model such as object identity, type constructors, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and versioning.
      
    </li><li>Design and implement a class.
      
    </li><li>Use subclassing to design simple class hierarchies that allow code to be reused for distinct subclasses.
      
    </li><li>Correctly reason about control flow in a program using dynamic dispatch.
      
    </li><li>Explain the relationship between object-oriented inheritance (code-sharing and overriding) and subtyping (the idea of a subtype being usable in a context that expects the supertype).
      
    </li><li>Use object-oriented encapsulation mechanisms such as interfaces and private members.
      
    </li><li>Write event handlers for use in reactive systems, such as GUIs.
      
    </li><li>For a language with a static type system, describe the operations that are forbidden statically, such as passing the wrong type of value to a function or method.
      
    </li><li>Explain how typing rules define the set of operations that are legal for a type.
      
    </li><li>Define and use program pieces (such as functions, classes, methods) that use generic types, including for collections.
      
    </li><li>Discuss the differences among generics, subtyping, and overloading.
      
    </li><li>Implement a divide-and-conquer algorithm for solving a problem.
      
    </li><li>Identify the data components and behaviors of multiple abstract data types.
      
    </li><li>Implement a coherent abstract data type, with loose coupling between components and behaviors.
