  Springer, 
  ISBN: 978-1-84882-914-5<h2>Objectives</h2><ul><li>Compare and contrast (1) the procedural/functional approach—defining a function for each operation with the function body providing a case for each data variant—and (2) the object-oriented approach—defining a class for each data variant with the class definition providing a method for each operation  Understand both as defining a matrix of operations and variants
      
    </li><li>Use object-oriented encapsulation mechanisms such as interfaces and private members
      
    </li><li>Write basic algorithms that avoid assigning to mutable state or considering reference equality
      
    </li><li>Write useful functions that take and return other functions
      
    </li><li>Compare and contrast (1) the procedural/functional approach—defining a function for each operation with the function body providing a case for each data variant—and (2) the object-oriented approach—defining a class for each data variant with the class definition providing a method for each operation  Understand both as defining a matrix of operations and variants
      
    </li><li>Correctly reason about variables and lexical scope in a program using function closures
      
    </li><li>Use functional encapsulation mechanisms such as closures and modular interfaces
      
    </li><li>Define and use iterators and other operations on aggregates, including operations that take functions as arguments, in multiple programming languages, selecting the most natural idioms for each language
      
    </li><li>Give an example program that does not type-check in a particular language and yet would have no error if run
      
    </li><li>Describe an abstract syntax tree for a small language
      
    </li><li>Use formal grammars to specify the syntax of languages
      
    </li><li>Use various advanced programming constructs and idioms correctly
      
    </li><li>Discuss how various advanced programming constructs aim to improve program structure, software quality, and programmer productivity
      
    </li><li>Discuss the role of concepts such as orthogonality and well-chosen defaults in language design
      
    </li><li>Use a logic language to implement a conventional algorithm.
