    </li><li>Describe current and emerging philosophies, roles, and practices for software development and testing
      
    </li><li>Apply a variety of software testing practices to a software development project
      
    </li><li>Describe and distinguish among the different types and levels of testing (unit, integration, systems, and acceptance)
    </li><li>Describe techniques for identifying significant test cases for integration, regression and system testing
      
    </li><li>Outline the process of regression testing and its role in release management
      
    </li><li>Create and document a set of tests for a medium-size code segment
      
    </li><li>Describe how to select good regression tests and automate them
      
    </li><li>Discuss the limitations of testing in a particular domain
      
    </li><li>Use a defect tracking tool to manage software defects in a small software project
      
    </li><li>Describe the difference between centralized and distributed software configuration management
      
    </li><li>Describe how version control can be used to help manage software release management
      
    </li><li>Identify configuration items and use a source code control tool in a small team-based project
      
    </li><li>Describe how available static and dynamic test tools can be integrated into the software development environment
      
    </li><li>Describe the issues that are important in selecting a set of tools for the development, testing, and deployment of a particular software system
      
    </li><li>Develop virtual environments for software development and deployment
