  ISBN: 978-1449330729<h2>Objectives</h2><ul><li>Implement basic numerical algorithms
      
    </li><li>For both a primitive and a compound type, informally describe the values that have that type
      
    </li><li>Describe examples of program errors detected by a type system
      
    </li><li>Discuss the importance of algorithms in the problem-solving process
      
    </li><li>Create algorithms for solving simple problems
      
    </li><li>Use a programming language to implement, test, and debug algorithms for solving simple problems
      
    </li><li>Implement, test, and debug simple recursive functions and procedures
      
    </li><li>Apply the techniques of decomposition to break a program into smaller pieces
      
    </li><li>Trace the execution of a variety of code segments and write summaries of their computations
      
    </li><li>Construct, execute and debug programs using a modern IDE and associated tools such as unit testing tools and visual debuggers
      
    </li><li>Construct and debug programs using the standard libraries available with a chosen programming language
      
    </li><li>Identify and describe uses of primitive data types
      
    </li><li>Write programs that use primitive data types
      
    </li><li>Modify and expand short programs that use standard conditional and iterative control structures and functions
      
    </li><li>Design, implement, test, and debug a program that uses each of the following fundamental programming constructs: basic computation, simple I/O, standard conditional and iterative structures, the definition of functions, and parameter passing
      
    </li><li>Write a program that uses file I/O to provide persistence across multiple executions
      
    </li><li>Choose appropriate conditional and iteration constructs for a given programming task
      
    </li><li>Describe the concept of recursion and give examples of its use
      
    </li></ul><h2>Outline</h2><ol><li>Simple numerical algorithms, such as computing the average of a list of numbers, finding the min, max, and mode in a list, approximating the square root of a number, or finding the greatest common divisor
